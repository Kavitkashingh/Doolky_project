  <h2>About Us</h2>
 <p> EazyDiner has been created by a team that is extremely passionate about food, wine and all things fine. As a collective group of Chefs and Hoteliers who have worked in some of the best hotels and restaurants around the world, we were always on the lookout for new dining experiences and exciting cuisines. It is this love and passion for eating and exploring that brought us together to create EazyDiner.</p>


<p>How often do you find yourself wondering, where you should go eat on a special occasion? What are the newest and top eateries in town? What are the things you absolutely must try when visiting a particular restaurant? Can you save some money while still dining at top restaurants of the city?</p>


<p>EazyDiner has all the answers for the most enjoyable, authentic and friction-free table booking experience. With an instant confirmation of less than 18 seconds, you can now book over 15,000+ restaurants in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata, Goa, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Chandigarh and over 150 cities in India &  Dubai on our swanky website or mobile app. For bookings in India, we also provide a 24 x 7 complimentary concierge service.</p>

 

<p>With every meal you book through EazyDiner, there comes a phenomenal deal ranging from free alcoholic drinks to up to 50% off on your total bill. With no membership fees or reservations charge, what is best is that these eye-popping deals are not for just one person, but are applicable on the entire table! Now, this is what I call a real deal!</p>

 

<p>EazyDiner is evolving each day to become your daily dining app by providing pre-paid discounted meals and vouchers, including upto 50% off at Chaayos, Burger King and many others! If we had our way, these prepaid meals would be the only gifts our families would be giving us!</p>

<p>With each booking, you also earn EazyPoints, which can be redeemed for an array of delicious treats. You earn points for booking through EazyDiner as well as by leaving user reviews on restaurant profiles. The more points you earn, the more delicious and exciting the rewards become!</p>


<p>Do take the time to #ThankTheStars - an initiative by EazyDiner which allows you to acknowledge the efforts of your servers and chefs at the restaurant and help them win amazing rewards while you get 200 EazyPoints for every review. It’s a total win-win.</p>
